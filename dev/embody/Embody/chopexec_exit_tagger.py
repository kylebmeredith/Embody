# channel - the Channel object which has changed

# val - the numeric value of the changed sample
# prev - the previous sample value

# Make sure the corresponding toggle is enabled in the CHOP Execute DAT.

# Tagger UI removed in Phase 5b -- discovery is par-driven now. This DAT
# is retained as an inert callback so any wiring inside the .toe still
# resolves; it will be deleted alongside the tagger COMP in Phase 5b.2.
